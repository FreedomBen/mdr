# Not yet Run

- I'd like to add a simple webview-style GUI around the HTML.  What are some options for doing this?  I'd like some options for native webview such as with GTK on Gnome, and also maybe some options like using Tauri.  I prefer it to be lightweight but also like the idea of cross-platform, though linux/gnome support is by far the most important.  Please provide some options and compare/contrast their pros/cons

- I'd like to modify the tool so when in default mode where it's binding to the web port, we don't actually write the .html file to the disk, but rather store it in memory and serve from there.  So we would only output the .html when the -o|--output flag is passed.  What are our options for this?

# Already Run

- If -o|--output is passed but has no argument after it, use the default out file

- I'd like to add a -w|--watch flag that will watch the source file and automatically rebuild the target html when the source is changed.  What are our options here?  Support for linux is top priority

- I'd like to add a flag that puts mdr into a file-serving mode where it will bind a local http server that serves up the html version of the file.  It should automatically watch and rebuild the source markdown file whenever it changes.  It should also hook up a websocket so it can automatically reload the file in the browser when the source file changes.  What are some options for this?

- Write an end-to-end test suite in Ruby that can be invoked with make test-integration.  Move the existing integration.rs to tests/integration/integration.rs and put the end-to-end test suite in tests/e2e/.  make test-integration should first build the app, and then call the end to end test suite entrypoint.  The end to end test suite should then invoke the app over the command line using the built binary like a user would.  Have a fixture markdown file that uses all possible markdown syntax and a fixture html file that we expect to be output.  You an use the existing fixture at tests/fixtures/full.md for the markdown file.  The end to end test suite should run through all uses of the app to ensure output is as expected.  Convert the input fixture with -o|--output flag and verify that output is correct.  Then bind mdr to http port and curl the file, verifying returned html is as expected.
