# Not yet Run

- I'd like to add a simple webview-style GUI around the HTML.  What are some options for doing this?  I'd like some options for native webview such as with GTK on Gnome, and also maybe some options like using Tauri.  I prefer it to be lightweight but also like the idea of cross-platform, though linux/gnome support is by far the most important.  Please provide some options and compare/contrast their pros/cons


# Already Run

- I'd like to add a -w|--watch flag that will watch the source file and automatically rebuild the target html when the source is changed.  What are our options here?  Support for linux is top priority

- I'd like to add a flag that puts mdr into a file-serving mode where it will bind a local http server that serves up the html version of the file.  It should automatically watch and rebuild the source markdown file whenever it changes.  It should also hook up a websocket so it can automatically reload the file in the browser when the source file changes.  What are some options for this?
